# count2rpkm_tpm
This script is designed to convert gene count data into RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase of transcript, per Million mapped reads) or TPM (Transcripts Per Million) values. It takes a tab-delimited input file containing gene counts, with the first column being the gene ID, and the last column optionally being the gene length.
