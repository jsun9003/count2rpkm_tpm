# count2rpkm_tpm
This script is designed to convert gene count data into RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase of transcript, per Million mapped reads) or TPM (Transcripts Per Million) values. It takes a tab-delimited input file containing gene counts, with the first column being the gene ID, and the last column optionally being the gene length. 

The script supports both sample-based and group-based calculations. Group-based results are generated by merging samples identified by replicate numbers in the sample names (e.g., _R1, _R2).

Key features:
- Converts raw gene counts to RPKM or TPM.
- Supports both sample-based and group-based calculations.
- Allows specifying gene lengths via a separate file.
- Flexible output options, including customizable output directory and file prefix.

Example usage:
```bash
python count2rpkm_tpm.py -i input_file.txt -l length_file.txt -m RPKM
python count2rpkm_tpm.py -i input_file.txt -l length_file.txt -m TPM
```

The script ensures that gene lengths are considered during the calculation and normalizes the data accordingly to provide accurate RPKM or TPM values.
